# SCP:SL Translations <br>

# NO LONGER ACCEPTING PUBLIC SUBMISSIONS.

</div>

We thank everyone who contributed to translating SCP:SL over the years. However, Translation management cannot ensure the quality of community-submitted translations going forward, and therefore they will no longer be accepted. Additionally, many languages (such as Dutch or Finnish) haven't been updated in years, causing inaccuracies in translations that worsen the game experience.

If you are interested in translating for us, join our Discord server (https://discord.gg/scpsl) and keep an eye on the #job-listings channel.

Should you have any questions, please contact DrJam√≥n#3745 or Red Z#5555.
